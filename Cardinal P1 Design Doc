---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe what happens in a call to timer_sleep(),
>> including the effects of the timer interrupt handler.

        Upon a call to timer_sleep(), the current thread is put to sleep for a
    given number of timer ticks and then woken back up. In this context, putting
    a thread to sleep means that the thread is put in a BLOCKED state and
    prevented from being scheduled for time on the cpu.

        This process occurs in three phases. First, timer_sleep() sets the
  wake_up_time for the thread and adds it to the sleep_list. This occurs with
  interrupts disabled so that the thread is not preempted before it can ascertain
  the correct time to wake up. Additionally, if the thread was preempted then it
  might not be inserted into the sleep_list in the correct position.The final
  job of timer_sleep() is to down the sleep semaphore of that thread. This has
  the effect of blocking the thread and prevents it from being scheduled.

        The second phase is checking if a thread should be woken. Becuase a call
    to the timer interrupt handler is made every time a 'tick' of the timer goes
    by, this was a natural place to perform test for waking threads. Every time
    the interrupt handler runs, a query is made to the sleep_list to see if any
  threads need to wake.

        The final phase is the process of actually waking a thread. Once the
    current number of OS ticks has equaled or surpassed the wake_up_time of a
    thread it can be woken up. First, the thread is popped from the sleep_list
    and finally its sleep semaphore is upped to ublock the thread and allow
    it to be scheduled again. From here the thread can continue to run or be
  put back to sleep again if necessary.


>> A3: What steps are taken to minimize the amount of time spent in
>> the timer interrupt handler?

        Care must be taken when operating withing the timer interrupt handler in
    order to prevent losing timer ticks or missing input. This was accomplished
    by minimizing the amount of code running in the hander in two distinct ways.
    The first deals with the differing priorities among threads that are
    sleeping. Solving that problem could be done from within the interrupt
    handler when the threads are about to wake. This would entail comparing the
    priorities and then selecting the correct thread to wake up. This might not
    always be the front of the sleeping list and so there would be more overhead
    to select the correct thread. Instead, we defined our wake_up_less function
    to sort on priority first and then on wake_up_time. This ensures that a
    higher priority thread wakes before a lower priority thread. Because this
    check is performed in our comparison function, all the work is done when a
    thread is added into the sleeping list and when in the interrupt handler all
    we need to do is pop the first thread from the sleeping list. The second way
    was to break out from the test_sleeping_thread function quickly when
    possible. Because a majority of the timer ticks will not involve waking a
    thread, we wrote that function to break as soon as it realizes that not
    enough time has passed to wake a sleeping thread.


---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> A4: How are race conditions avoided when multiple threads call
>> timer_sleep() simultaneously?

        Race conditions are avoided because interrupts are disabled before a
    thread sets it wake time and is added to the sleep list. This way, once
    timer_sleep() is called for the current thread, its allowed to finish setting
    its wake_up_time before another thread can access the information. This
  way, another thread cannot accidently usurp the start and wake time of another
    thread leading to both having incorrect wake_up_times.

>> A5: How are race conditions avoided when a timer interrupt occurs
>> during a call to timer_sleep()?

        In our implementation timer_sleep() temporarily disables interrupts in
    order to add the thread to the sleep_list. The interrupt won't be serviced
    until the thread has been added and it is safe to do so. Once the sleep_list
    has reached a stable state then the interrupt handler may resume it's task of
    testing the threads on the sleep_list. This model must be used because
    interrupt handlers are not able to sleep and/or acquire locks themselves.


---- RATIONALE ----

>> A6: Why did you choose this design?  In what ways is it superior to
>> another design you considered?

        The main reason this design was chosen is that it eliminates the
    busy-waiting design. Our goal was to create a solution that was intuitive
    and easy to understand but reduced the cpu overhead associated with busy
    waiting. Our initial pass at a design was to handle each instance of 
    blocking and unblocking a thread manually. The idea with this approach was
    to reduce the amount of code executing while interrupts were disabled. Upon 
    review we found that the extra layer of abstraction offered by using a 
    semaphore greatly simplified our design.

>> B2: Explain the data structure used to track priority donation.

    Priority donation is tracked though a list that each thread maintains. Each
  time a thread donates it's priority to the current thread it's added to the
  donor_list. In this way a chain of donations is kept track of for each thread
  that has it's effective priority manipulated.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: How do you ensure that the highest priority thread waiting for
>> a lock, semaphore, or condition variable wakes up first?

    In our design we maintain an ordered list for threads that are waiting on
  a semaphore. The list is in descending order of priority (higest priority
  in front) so that the semaphore can be certain the thread at the front of the
  list has the highest priority.


>> B4: Describe the sequence of events when a call to lock_acquire()
>> causes a priority donation.  How is nested donation handled?

    First, a lock is acquired by a thread with a relatively low priority. The
  low priority thread holds the lock which is great, but it will never receive
  any cpu time if threads with higher priority are on the ready list. Then, a
  thread with a relatively high priority makes a call to lock_acquire(). At this
  point, the thread is added to the list of donor threads that is being maintained
  by the thread holding the lock. Now, the thread attempts to donate it's
  effective priority up the list of waiting threads. Each thread in turn has its
  effective priority boosted to that of the donor thread and then passes that
  donation on to the next thread until the thread holding the lock is reached.


>> B5: Describe the sequence of events when lock_release() is called
>> on a lock that a higher-priority thread is waiting for.

    When lock_release() is called, the function iterates through all the
  current threads donors in order to unblock them from the released lock. Then, 
  a function is called to re-synchronize the priorities of the waiting threads
  which essentially recalculates the donations that need to take place now that 
  the current thread has released the lock. The result being that the next 
  thread in line for the lock should have an effective priority equal to the 
  priority of the highest thread waiting for the lock.


---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B6: Describe a potential race in thread_set_priority() and explain
>> how your implementation avoids it.  Can you use a lock to avoid
>> this race?

    A possible race condition in thread_set_priority() occurs when two different
  higher priority threads are both attempting to donate their effective_priority
  to the same thread. Our implementation avoids this because a thread acquires 
  a lock in order to donate it's priority and doesn't release the lock until it
  has propogated along the entire list of waiting threads.

    Calculating the recent_cpu time was ambiguous because it should be recalculated
  every second but the table only runs for 36 timer ticks which does not span an
  entire second. Also, there is ambiguity about what happens when two or more
  threads with the same priority are attempting to run. In this case I asserted
  that the thread with the higher nice value will yield.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Our choice to perform valuable load recalculation inside the interrupt_handler may be advised against, but
we felt that that in doing so, we didn't have to turn interrupts off/on, 
which could ultimately cause timer ticks to become off, lose incoming events, and cause the computer
to appear slugglish.
=======
    Due to the nature of our design there are occasional times when the 
  interrupt handler is required to perform some lengthy calculations. Fortunately,
  the bulk of this occurs when recalculating the system load average which only
  occurs once every 100 timer ticks (once per second). Between this and the 
  priority calculation which occurs every fourth tick there is bound to be some
  performance degredation. We reasoned that it was acceptable considering that 
  the calculations were only being performed on a portion of the timer interrupts.

    Although the design is functional, given more time we would attempt to 
  streamline the amount of code that was forced to run in the context of the
  interrupt handler.

    A number of considerations went into our implementation of the fixed_point
  math. Although a fixed point number can be simply represented as an integer,
  we chose to create a new data type for fixed-point numbers. We implemented a
  new struct to represent a number that should be treated in a fixed-point
  context. This was nothing more than an integer wrapped inside the struct but
  it provids some definite benefits. Creating a new type lets the compiler help
  us out by performing type checking. This removes any ambiguity surrounding
  what is returing from a functing or what the argument to a function should be.
  It makes it much easier for the programmer to know when and where they should
  be using a fixed point values as opposed to an integer.

    Another design decision was to define the bit format and conversion factors
  as preprocessor directives. The conversion factor gets used in a number of
  calculations so hard-coding that value would be a poor design choice. This
  way, a user can merely change the values correlating to the fixed-point format
  and all changes to the conversion factor and functions will cascade through.

    Finally, each function could have been implemented as a macro but we
  decided to implement the arithmetic as inline functions. The main reason for
  this was to try and avoid bugs created by unexpected compiler behavior when
  expanding the macros.
